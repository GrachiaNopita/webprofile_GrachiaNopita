            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, I'm Grachia Nopita, a 19-year-old undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering 
              at Palangka Raya University. Palangka Raya, my hometown, has been a witness to the development of my interest in the world of technology 
              since a young age. My educational journey at Palangka Raya University is not just about studies; it's an adventure that opens the door 
              to the enchanting world of coding and technology. Since stepping into the academic world, I've felt the magic of creating something 
              meaningful from lines of code and how technological innovations shape our future. My passion for understanding, creating, and engaging in the world 
              of programming is not just a job but the driving force in every step I take. Beyond the computer screen, I also have a love 
              for adventure and the beauty of nature. Amidst the hustle of IT projects, I gladly take time to immerse myself in the freedom of the great outdoors. 
              Adventures in the forest or hiking in the mountains provide a fresh spirit and inspiration, filling my life with the necessary balance.

            <h2>Journey</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning in Kapuas, where I lived and attended school during my childhood, it bore witness to the early 
              chapters of my growth and adventures in elementary school. However, life is full of surprises, leading me to 
              Palangka Raya upon entering junior high school. In this city, I experienced the vibrancy of a different urban life, 
              facing new experiences and challenges that sculpted my personality. Fate, however, had other plans, prompting my 
              return to Kapuas for my high school years. This journey back opened a new chapter with challenges and obstacles that enriched 
              my high school experience, shaping me into a stronger and more spirited individual. When the time came to select a university 
              for higher education, my choice circled back to Palangka Raya, where my journey began. As a student at Palangka Raya University, 
              I commemorate achievements, memories, and all experiences that have molded me from childhood to the present. At every step, this 
              journey isn't merely about reaching goals; it's also a process of continuous growth and development. Kapuas and Palangka Raya both 
              constitute integral parts of the unfolding chapters of my life. 
              May this narrative inspire those planning their unique life journey.
